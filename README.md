## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is Sriharsha Kandala!

## About me
I am a software engineer with a background in computational fluid dynamics. I am passionate about developing efficient and scalable software for HPC on distributed CPU and GPU platforms. I am interested in both traditional (computational physics) and modern (AI/ML) HPC applications.

My doctoral work involved development of `Specsolve`, a distributed spectral element solver for simulation of incompressible turbulent flows in complex
domains. The code is written in C++ and uses MPI for communication. 

Some of the open-source projects I contributed to include:
- [RRTMGP.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/RRTMGP.jl): A 2-stream radiatiation transfer model.
- [ClimaComms.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaComms.jl): Communications infrastructure for the dynamical core.
- [ClimaCore.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaCore.jl): Spatial discretizations for the dynamical core.
- [ClimaAtmos.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl): The atmosphere model.
- [ClimaInterpolations.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaInterpolations.jl): A collection of interpolation tools for the `CliMA` ecosytem.
- [ClimateMachine.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl): Our earlier atmosphere model based on discontinuous Galerkin method.

My JuliaCon 2024 talk on communications patterns and scaling of our dynamical core can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf49ukec-Rc).
